## What does the program?
* Request coordinates.
* Find in what sector the subject is.
* If the coordinate is exactly under a red line shared, it must be indicated the two sectors that shared the position of the subject.
* If the sector is outside of the antens, it must be executed the instruction _print("The subject has escaped")_
* The antenna cant't be mesured, the program don't show anything.
